# Project Overview:
Although carpooling is a feature on transportation apps like Uber and Lyft, the feature is not being utilized to its fullest potential. While you can share rides with other passengers, these passengers are often strangers. For college students, safety and cost is a major concern when using these apps. The carpool rides can often be overpriced and unsettling for young students who are not familiar with the other passengers. These apps also do not guarantee your safety in relation to other passengers you could be riding with. The majority of freshman do not have their own cars. If college students were given a choice; it is more likely that they would choose to ride with fellow students, people with viewable profiles, or verified mutual friends. Also, it is very expensive to have ubers drive long distances for events. It is also unfeasable for ubers to drive into the mountains for hiking and snowboarding (especially in areas where there is no service). There is no guarantee that if the uber driver is willing to drive that far to drop you off, that you would be able to get a ride back.
	
Our solution to this problem is to create a website that allows students to organize safe and efficient carpool transportation. This website would resemble a social media platform with users posting their destinations and offering other users carpool options based off of the posted destinations. People will be able to share payment information to split the costs of gas and parking. If there is a large event, drivers can attach their available car to a searchable event. There are several benefits to this solution, including the increased safety precaution, cost efficiency, and reduced environmental impact. Safety in this situation is vital, especially for college aged women, as accepting a ride from a complete stranger can be uncomfortable. We believe that the risk and discomfort of carpooling will ease if the drivers and riders are required to be verified college students. Our target demographic (college students), are known for having little disposable income, which makes it difficult for them to use services like Uber or Lyft that charge a hefty amount. Our platform will minimize the cost of ride sharing because it is likely that the most expenses will solely be for gas. If we can encourage students to utilize this platform then there will be a decreased environmental impact associated with the transportation of college students. This is also a new and innovative way for students to socialize amongst themselves.
